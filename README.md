Do them in order. 
I want to be able to list the names of all of the players in the league.
I want a player to have a name, team, number, and age. This should show up in the player list.
I want to find a particular player in the league by their name and number (a player is the right player only if they have both the correct name & correct number).
I want to be able to choose between listing and finding players and not have both happen when to program starts.
I want to continue choosing options until I choose to Quit
I want the list of all players in the league to also list all of the coaches in the league. Coaches are not be findable like players are. Coaches have a name, team, and title.
I want to see all of the players (and coaches) on a single team.
I want to be able to trade a player (but not a coach) from one team to another.
I want to see all of the players who are older than a certain age.
I want to load all of the players (and coaches) in the league from a text file.
I want to record the results of a game. This means that one team would win and another lose (or they would tie).
I want to display the win/loss/tie record for a particular team.
